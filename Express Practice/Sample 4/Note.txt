1. Show index.html on landing Page('/').

2. When Users enters the data and submits the page

a.   If User enters anything other than number in the text field, show index.html

b.  If User enters odd number and selects 'Even'  OR User enters even number and selects 'Odd' display Error Page ( Error handler should display)

c. For right data, i.e. Even number with even selection and odd Number with odd selection, display history.

History  should be displayed in this fashion, lets say inputs are 

2  Even, 3  Odd, 5 Odd, 6 Even 

{ 2:'Even', 3: 'Odd', 5:'Odd', 6:'Even'} 

ORDER doesnt matter

NOTE: All Code in server, no client-side javascript

routes in separate file,
use post-redirect pattern
The History should be stored in separate new file, neither in routes and nor in  server file.
